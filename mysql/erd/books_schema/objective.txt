Your Task: Create an ERD to represent the database for an application that tracks users, books, and user's favorite books.

Each book should have an id, title, and each user should be able to save their favorite books.
Use the MySQL Workbench for creating this database.

Create a new model (ERD)

Name the schema books_schema

Create a table called users

Add the fields to the users table including: id, name, created_at and updated_at

Create a table called books

Add fields to the books table including: id, title, num_of_pages, created_at, and updated_at

Create a many to many relationship between users and books and rename the joining table to favorites

Change the field names to the singular pronoun. ie. user_id and book_id

Save your ERD as a .mwb file and submit it to the platform
