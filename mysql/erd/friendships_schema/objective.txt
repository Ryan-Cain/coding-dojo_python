Create an ERD to represent the database for an application that tracks users and their friends.

Each user should have an id, first_name, last_name, created_at and updated_at. Create a self join relationship (many to many to same table), where a user can have a friend (another user from the same table). Use the MySQL Workbench for creating this diagram.

Create a new model (ERD)

Name the schema friendships_schema

Create a table called users and add the following fields: id, first_name, last_name, created_at and updated_at

Create a many to many relationship to the users table and rename it friendships

Add the following fields into the friendship table: id, created_at and updated_at

Rename the relationship fields to user_id and friend_id

Save your ERD as a .mwb file and submit it to the platform
